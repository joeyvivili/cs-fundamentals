## Class   
- Attributes
- Methods
    
🔹 Object Oriented Programming (OOP)   
-  Abstraction barriers enforce the **boundaries** between different aspects of a large program.
-  Object-oriented programming is particularly well-suited to programs that model systems that have separate but interacting parts.
-  Discussion_07 -- elegant code design


🔹 Inheritence
- Base class (parent class) & Subclass (child class)
    - A subclass inherits the attributes of its base class, but may **override** certain attributes, including certain methods.
    - With inheritance, we only specify what is **different** between the subclass and the base class. Anything that we leave unspecified in the subclass is automatically assumed to behave just as it would for the base class.
    - Python supports the concept of a subclass inheriting attributes from multiple base classes -- multiple inheritance.

## Mutability
Linked List vs. List  

List (mutable) vs. Tuple (immutable)
- pass-by-value(copy) vs pass-by-reference
    - 🔹 pass-by-value (copy)
        - A new copy of the data is made
        - Changes don’t affect the original
    - 🔹 pass-by-refernce
        - A reference (pointer) to the original object is passed
        - Mutations affect the original
      
Key:  
- Names point to objects.
- Assignment rebinds names.
- Mutation changes objects.
