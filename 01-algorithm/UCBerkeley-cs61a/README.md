Linked List vs. List  

List (mutable) vs. Tuple (immutable)
- pass-by-value(copy) vs pass-by-reference
    - 🔹 pass-by-value (copy)
        - A new copy of the data is made
        - Changes don’t affect the original
    - 🔹 pass-by-refernce
        - A reference (pointer) to the original object is passed
        - Mutations affect the original
      
Key:  
- Names point to objects.
- Assignment rebinds names.
- Mutation changes objects.
